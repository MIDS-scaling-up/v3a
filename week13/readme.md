# Lecture 13
In this bonus lecture, we explore cross-polination and synergy between neuroscience and deep learning research based on a paper on reconstructing images from MRI signals: **Takagi, Yu & Nishimoto, Shinji. (2022). High-resolution image reconstruction with latent diffusion models from human brain activity. 10.1101/2022.11.18.517004.** (https://sites.google.com/view/stablediffusion-with-brain/?pli=1, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v3.full.pdf)
